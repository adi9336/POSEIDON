# Data Visualization

1. Choose chart type from intent:
   time trend -> line, profile -> depth curve, compare groups -> grouped line/bar.
2. Include axes units and source metadata.
3. Prefer Plotly for interactive outputs and Matplotlib for static exports.
4. Add a short interpretation caption with confidence.
5. If data is sparse, recommend alternate aggregation windows.
